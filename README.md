# fakathon (Fake Face Image Classification Challenge)


About
This competition is being organised by the Heuristics Club (a sub-club of KamandPrompt), IIT Mandi for Utkarsh 2021.

Goal of the Competition
In the challenge, images of human faces are provided. The goal of this challenge is to classify whether a given image has a real face or a fake face.

Context
Nowadays, with the advent of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), there are lots of fake images and videos of people on the internet. These algorithms can generate very accurate and realistic looking images and videos. This is a big issue because it can be used to attack public figures, spread fake news, etc. So, to identify whether any particular piece of content is fake or not is an important problem that needs to be tackled.

Since no algorithm is perfect in this task as of now, so this is an interesting problem to solve with deep learning.
